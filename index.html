        <h3>Question 2:</h3>
        <p>
            Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions in
            JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            <code>Synchronous and asynchronous functions refer to how JavaScript manages
            the execution of code.
            <br /><br />
            **Synchronous Functions:** In synchronous operations, each task must
            wait for the previous one to complete before moving on. It follows a
            sequential and blocking execution model, meaning if there's a
            time-consuming task, it will block the execution until completed. For
            example, imagine fetching data from a server synchronously; the entire
            program will halt until the data is received.
            <br /><br />
            **Asynchronous Functions:** On the other hand, asynchronous operations
            don't wait for a task to finish before moving on to the next one.
            Instead, it allows the program to continue executing while the
            time-consuming task operates in the background. This non-blocking
            behavior is particularly useful for tasks like data fetching, where we
            don't want to freeze the entire application while waiting for data.
            <br /><br />
            In JavaScript, asynchronous behavior is often achieved using callbacks,
            promises, and async/await. These mechanisms allow developers to handle
            tasks like fetching data or reading files without blocking the main
            thread, providing a more responsive user experience.</code>

        <h3>Question 2:</h3>
        <p>What are the data types in JavaScript?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            JavaScript has several data types including string, number, boolean,
            object, and more.
